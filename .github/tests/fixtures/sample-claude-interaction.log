Task: implement complex authentication system

Analyzing requirements...

‚ùì I need more information to proceed with this implementation:

1. Which authentication method do you prefer?
   - JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
   - OAuth 2.0
   - Session-based authentication
   - Other

2. Should we support multi-factor authentication (MFA)?

3. Do you need social login integration (Google, GitHub, etc.)?

4. What user roles and permissions structure do you envision?

Could you provide more details about these authentication requirements?
I'm waiting for your clarification before proceeding with the implementation.

Exit code: 0
