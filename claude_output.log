Hi! I'm Claude Code, ready to help you with your NestJS project. 

I can see you're working on a NestJS backend with Prisma and Redis. The project has a nice DX CLI setup and follows a modular architecture with global services.

How can I help you today? I can assist with:
- Adding new features or modules
- Database schema changes and migrations
- API endpoint development
- Bug fixes
- Code refactoring
- Testing
- Or anything else related to your codebase

What would you like to work on?
