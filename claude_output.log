Hi! I'm Claude Code, ready to help you with software engineering tasks in this NestJS project.

I can see you're working on a NestJS backend application with Prisma (PostgreSQL) and Redis. The project is currently on the `issue_5` branch with some modified files.

How can I help you today? I can assist with:
- Building features or fixing bugs
- Database migrations and schema changes
- Testing and debugging
- Code refactoring
- Explaining code structure
- Or anything else related to this codebase

What would you like to work on?
