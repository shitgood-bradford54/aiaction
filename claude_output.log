Hi! I'm Claude Code, ready to help you with software engineering tasks in this NestJS/Prisma project.

I can assist you with:
- Building and running the application (development, debug, or production)
- Database operations (migrations, seeding, Prisma Studio)
- Writing and testing code
- Code quality checks (linting, formatting)
- Environment setup and validation
- General NestJS/Prisma questions

What would you like to work on?
