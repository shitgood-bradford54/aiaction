Hi! I'm Claude Code, ready to help you with your software engineering tasks in this NestJS project.

I can see you're working on a NestJS backend with Prisma and Redis. The project uses a modular architecture with global services and has a unified `dx` CLI tool for managing development tasks.

How can I help you today? Some things I can assist with:
- Adding new features or modules
- Fixing bugs or issues
- Database migrations and schema changes
- Writing tests
- Code refactoring
- Explaining parts of the codebase
- Setting up the development environment

What would you like to work on?
