Hi! I'm Claude, ready to help you with your NestJS backend project. 

I can see this is a NestJS application with Prisma (PostgreSQL) and Redis, currently on the `issue_5` branch. There's one modified file (`claude_output.log`) in the working directory.

How can I help you today? I can assist with:
- Building features or fixing bugs
- Database schema changes and migrations
- API endpoint development
- Testing and code quality
- Environment configuration
- Or any other development tasks

What would you like to work on?
