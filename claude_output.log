Hi! I'm Claude Code, ready to help you with your NestJS backend project. 

I can see you're working on a NestJS application with Prisma and Redis. The codebase has a nice modular architecture with global services and a unified `dx` CLI tool for managing development tasks.

How can I help you today? I can assist with:
- Adding new features or modules
- Debugging issues
- Database migrations
- Testing
- Code refactoring
- Or any other development tasks

What would you like to work on?
