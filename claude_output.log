Hi! I'm Claude, here to help you with your NestJS backend project.

I can see you're working in a NestJS application with Prisma and Redis. The project has a nice DX CLI tool (`./scripts/dx`) for managing various development tasks, and you're currently on the `issue_7` branch.

Is there something specific you'd like help with? I can assist with:
- Adding new features or modules
- Debugging issues
- Database migrations
- Code refactoring
- Testing
- Or anything else related to your project

What would you like to work on?
